"""Zabbix API definitions for alerts, actions, media types, and scripts.

This module covers the "Alerts & Actions" domain of the Zabbix API:
- **action**: Automated responses to events (trigger actions, discovery actions,
  autoregistration actions, internal actions, service actions). Actions define
  conditions and operations such as sending notifications or executing scripts.
- **alert**: Read-only log of notifications and remote commands that Zabbix has
  generated as a result of actions. Useful for auditing and troubleshooting
  notification delivery.
- **mediatype**: Notification delivery channels (Email, SMS, Slack, webhook,
  custom scripts, etc.). Media types must be configured before actions can send
  notifications.
- **script**: Global scripts that can be executed on hosts from the frontend,
  API, or as action operations. Includes IPMI, SSH, Telnet, and custom scripts.
